        <p>
          When you utilize our app to access our servers, we may routinely
          record the standard data provided by your device. This data can
          encompass your device's Internet Protocol (IP) address, its type and
          version, your activity within the app, the date and time of your
          actions, and other particulars regarding your usage. Furthermore, in
          cases where you encounter specific errors while using the app, we
          automatically gather data concerning the error and the circumstances
          surrounding its occurrence. This information might include technical
          specifics related to your device, the actions you were attempting when
          the error occurred, and other technical information relevant to the
          issue. It's possible that you may or may not receive notifications
          about these errors, either at the time they happen, when they have
          occurred, or regarding the error's nature. It's important to note that
          while this information may not on its own personally identify
          individuals, it could potentially be combined with other data to
          ascertain the identity of specific persons.
